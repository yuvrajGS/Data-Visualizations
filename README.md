# Data-Visualizations


## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to identify meaningful questions, gather and process the required data, and envision the answer through our visualizations. 
The datasets used in this project include those that involve greenhouse gas emissions, COVID-19 cases worldwide, geolocated place names in Canada, and the populations of countries in the world. 
For each dataset a visualization is derived taking into account the specific attributes of the data and the meaningful question at hand. 


## Methodology
Our analysis involved the following steps:

We structured the data in a way that allowed us to create appropriate visualizations for each question.
We used the prescriptive ASSERT model to guide our analysis and organize our findings.
We utilized a range of visualizations, including scatter plots, choropleth maps, overlapping density plots, and line graphs, to present our findings.
We answered each question in a meaningful way by presenting relevant data and using appropriate visualizations.
We provided insights into the datasets based on our analysis.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis provided insights into the datasets by answering each meaningful question. 
We structured the data in order to create plots in accordance with the requirements of the questions and chose to use several visualizations to depict our findings. 
To do this, we utilized a range of visualizations including scatter plots, choropleth maps, overlapping density plots, and line graphs. 
Overall using the prescriptive ASSERT model has allowed us to organize the findings of our data, and illustrate the visualizations to our questions.
